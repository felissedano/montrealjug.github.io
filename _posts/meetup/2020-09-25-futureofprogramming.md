In collaboration with [SouJava](https://soujava.org.br/, we are honored to present Mr. Robert.C Martin.
 
__The Future of Programming, by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)__

How did our industry start, what paths did it take to get to where we are, and where is it going. 
What big problems did programmers encounter in the past? How were they solved? 
And how do those solutions impact our future? What mistakes have we made as a profession; and how are we going to correct them. 
In this talk, Uncle Bob describes the history of software, from it’s beginnings in 1948 up through the current day; and then beyond. 
By looking at our past trajectory, we try to plot out where our profession is headed, and what challenges we’ll face along the way.
