__Machine Learning Exposed: The Fundamentals__

In the age of quantum computing, computer chip implants and artificial intelligence, it’s easy to feel left behind. For example, the term "machine learning" is increasingly bandied about in corporate settings and cocktail parties, but what is it, really?

In this session, James Weaver will give a gentle introduction to machine learning topics such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. He’ll also give you an overview of what you can achieve with machine learning, as well as an intuition on the maths behind it.

The presenter is very aware that some material on machine learning can be maths-intensive, and off-putting if you are not confident with your calculus. Conversely, some material doesn’t go into enough detail so you don’t get a feel for how things actually work. This session will start right at the beginning with the basics, and build up in an approachable way to some of the most interesting techniques so you can get the most out of your machine learning adventure.
