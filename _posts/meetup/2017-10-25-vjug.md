Le Montréal JUG participe au [vJUG24](https://virtualjug.com/vjug24/) , une conférence durant 24h et impliquant 24 JUGs dans le monde. Nous avons aussi la chance d'être au moment d'une keynote. Vous êtes donc privilégiés.

The Montréal JUG is part of the [vJUG24](https://virtualjug.com/vjug24/) and will live stream at Oracle this talk. This is a one-time per year event and we were lucky enough to be selected! Also, we are positioned on a keynote slot.

__Important__: Ça commence à __19h précise__. It starts at __19h sharp__.

__Comme ça marche__: Comme un JUG normal. Sauf que le présentateur est à distance et nous pouvons (et somme les seuls lors de notre heure) intervenir à tout moment. Et nous sommes diffusés dans le monde entier.

__Talk summary__: This presentation covers highlights and differences in the Kotlin language as compared to Java, emphasizing some of the points that might compel you to consider moving to Kotlin. Points will be made through examples taken from the upcoming Atomic Kotlin book.

__Bio__: Bruce Eckel is a computer programmer and consultant. He’s given hundreds of presentations throughout the world, published over 150 articles in numerous magazines, was a founding member of the ANSI/ISO C++ committee and speaks regularly at conferences. He was the creator and chair of both the C++ andJava tracks at the Software Development Conference, was cofounder of theEnterprise Architecture Summit and JavaPosse Roundup Conferences, and creator of the [Winter Tech Forum](https://www.WinterTechForum.com) and [Software ArchitectureForum](https://softwarearchitectureforum.com/). He also runs periodic [DeveloperRetreats](https://www.Developer-Retreat.com) which explore various software topics.
His technical blog can be found at BruceEckel.github.io.
Since 2009 he’s been studying management and alternative organizational structures and periodically writes about them in his blog at www.reinventing-business.com.
