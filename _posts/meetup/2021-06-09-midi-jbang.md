Why should you need to download java, set up a build system and configure your IDE to just play with java and do some scripting and automation tasks?
Why is there always this overhead and everyone seem to just accept it or go use another language?
http://jbang.dev questions this inherent complexity the Java ecosystem has built up over the 25 years.
Come to this talk to see Java be as accessible as you ever have seen it before and how with a little bit of Java we make java fun again.
