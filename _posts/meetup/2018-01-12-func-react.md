__From Functional to Reactive Programming__

**Sponsored by ![DevNexus](/images/sponsors/devnexus.png){:class="img-responsive"}** The well-known and awesome conference 
that we are always pleased to attend. February 21-23 2018. [Register](https://devnexus2018.ajug.org/s/register-overview) now.

We're in the midst of renewed interest in functional programming. At the same time we see quite a bit of excitement around 
reactive programming. Where did reactive programming come from? How is it related to functional programming, if at all? 

In this presentation we will discuss the merits of reactive programming and how functional programming concepts seamlessly 
transition into the programming model espoused by reactive programming.
