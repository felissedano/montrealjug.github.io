Nous commençons la saison 2018-19 avec un présentateur mondialement reconnu. Il a gracieusement accepté de nous faire
deux présentations au contenu très différent.

We are kicking off the season with a, well, a seasoned speaker. He has graciously accepted to do two really different talks.
 
So, two talks for the price of one :

__1. Making the Long Road Short__

**Java EE** (now Jakarta EE) is a well-established standard for creating enterprise Java applications and powers many critical applications with long lifespans. A frequent question is this: how can I **gain access to the power of Spring & Spring Boot** to take advantage of their dependency management, CDI, ease of data/streams use & integration, reactive programming, first-class Kotlin support, or any of a number of other capabilities? What are preferred migration patterns to smooth the path?

__2. Convince your Company__

Cloud Native, Docker, DevOps, microservices, and more: we go to conferences and get excited about the potential of so many things that could revolutionize our development and change our organizational and professional lives! And then, we go home... ​and hit the wall. If you’ve ever asked yourself, "This stuff is cool, but **HOW CAN I GET MY COMPANY TO DO IT?!?**", this is the session for you.
