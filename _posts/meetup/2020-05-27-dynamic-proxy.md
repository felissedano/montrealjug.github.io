I (Henri), am pleased this month to receive the Java Specialist himself. 
Heinz Kabutz is one of the most knowledgeable Java expert in the word and someone who genuinely tries to make the world a better place. 
He made me do 5000 push-ups in a month last year.

If you are not a subscriber to his newsletter, [go do it](https://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive/subscribe.jsp)!

He will talk about a topic that isn't as known as it should. 
But they are all over you (EasyMock, Spring, Hibernate, JakartaEE). 
He wrote a full eBook about it. Go [get it](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/java-dynamic-proxies/)!
 
__Dynamic Proxies in Java by Heinz Kabutz (in English)__

Java frameworks often need to dynamically create classes. 
One approach to do that easily in Java is dynamic proxies. 
In this talk, we will show how they compare to hand-written classes. 
We will then examine how we can use dynamic proxies to reduce the amount of code that we have to write. 
We also briefly explore other dynamically implemented patterns, such as decorator, adapter, and composite.

Dr Heinz M. Kabutz is the author of The Java Specialists' Newsletter, in which he explores all sorts of interesting nooks and crannies of the Java ecosystem. 
He is a Java Champion and a frequent speaker at all the best Java conferences, and some of the worst.
