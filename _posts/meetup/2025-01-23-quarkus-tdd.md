__Quarkus Compare & Contrast + Test-Driven Development It's easier than you think__

### 1. Quarkus Compare & Contrast

Are you a Spring developer and interested in learning something new ?

In this session I will show concepts and conventions familiar to Spring developers and how those same concepts and conventions can be implemented in Quarkus, all while highlighting similarities and differences between them, including how testing is done.

Additionally, I will highlight performance characteristics between them and prove, live, that you could save 50% in your operational costs and reduce your carbon emissions 2-3x simply by switching your Java runtime.

### 2. Test-Driven Development: It's easier than you think!

Everyone loves writing tests, don‚Äôt they? How do you write good tests? What tools are available for you to write good tests?

In this session, I will dive into the many features of Quarkus that help developers write good tests.

I will highlight some of the features of Quarkus, Dev Services and Continuous Testing, which help make testing easier. Additionally, I will live code some tests for common use cases developers encounter, including unit, integration, and ‚Äúblack box‚Äù testing of imperative and reactive RESTful and event-driven applications that use common services, such as databases and Kafka brokers.

I will discuss techniques such as mocking, spying, and interaction-based testing/verification.

I'll even spend some time showing how IDE-based AI assistants can help!

Once you see how easy TDD really can be there isn't a reason to not do it!
