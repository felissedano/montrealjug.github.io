√âv√©nement en pr√©sentiel - Il n'y aura pas de rediffusion
Participez √† notre meetup de rentr√©e en Avril ! En pr√©sentiel üéâ

The software industrial revolution has arrived. Software is now 80% open source and third-party and 20% proprietary code that stitches it together into business-critical applications. We are challenged with the ongoing evolution of increasingly large and diversely composed codebases and ecosystems. Dependencies are changing frequently and evolve at their own pace. Security vulnerabilities can be introduced at any time by anyone. Not updating regularly leads to critical bugs, performance, and security issues.

In this talk, we‚Äôll introduce OpenRewrite, an automated refactoring and dependency management technology that was born at Netflix in 2016. We‚Äôll write the code for a recipe live that fixes a common issue and execute it across 300 million lines of open-source code. The recipe will be available in open source for you to apply to your own codebase at the end of the session.

L'√©v√®nement se d√©roulera dans les locaux de Morgan Stanley , 700 Wellington St, Montreal, Quebec H3C 3S4
Ouverture des portes : 17H30 et d√©but de l'√©v√©nement : 18 h !
