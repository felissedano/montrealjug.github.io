Let‚Äôs face it, Java has a complicated relationship with dependencies. We even have a term for it: dependency hell.

Visualizing a dependency tree is hard, making good choices in upgrading existing dependencies is difficult, and nowadays effectively choosing new open source libraries is a challenge. So much so that last year 69% of dependency upgrades made by organizations were suboptimal. The implications of these decisions in terms of technical debt and security risk are potentially huge.
We can do better. In this talk learn about new tools and successful practices for choosing open source dependencies and avoiding the suboptimal.
