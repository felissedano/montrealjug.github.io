__Modern Data Streaming and Processing with Apache Kafka and NoSQL  (en anglais)__

*Pour la rentrée, le MontrealJUG vous propose de vous plonger dans les flux de données avec Kafka et les bases de donnée NoSQL.*
*For back to school season, the MontrealJUG is happy to host a session about Date streaming with Kafka and NoSQL databases.*

__Description__

Modern microservice-based architecture needs to exchange data in a fast and reliable way.

The use of distributed streaming platforms such as Apache Kafka makes the job easier, but that's not enough.

Applications also use NoSQL databases to store information that comes from one or more sources. So it makes perfect sense to use Kafka and NoSQL to create a distributed streaming and processing pipeline between applications.

This session explores such architecture, deploying applications using Redis NoSQL Database and sending events to a second application with Kafka and Jakarta EE technologies such as JNoSQL to connect to the database and receive Kafka messages as CDI events.
